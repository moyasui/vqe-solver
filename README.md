# vqe-solver
Project for FYS5419 Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning. 
This repository contains [all source code](https://github.com/moyasui/vqe-solver/tree/main/src) and the [report](https://github.com/moyasui/vqe-solver/blob/main/latex/vqe.pdf). 
The slides for the final presentation is [here](https://github.com/moyasui/vqe-solver/blob/main/pre/pre.pdf). 
  
## How to run
Run the Jupyter Notebooks, 
- For the one qubit system, see [**vqe-1.ipynb**](https://github.com/moyasui/vqe-solver/blob/main/src/vqe-1.ipynb)
- For the two qubit system, see [**vqe-2.ipynb**](https://github.com/moyasui/vqe-solver/blob/main/src/vqe-2.ipynb)
- For the Lipkin Model (both the $J=1$ and $J=2$ cases), see [**vqe-lipkin.ipynb**](https://github.com/moyasui/vqe-solver/blob/main/src/vqe-lipkin.ipynb)
- The Quantum Computing basics classes are in [**base.py**](https://github.com/moyasui/vqe-solver/blob/main/src/base.py)
- The VQE class is in [**algorithms.py**](https://github.com/moyasui/vqe-solver/blob/main/src/algorithms.py)

All the plots will either be shown or saved to the plots folders, one should be able to recreate the plots included in the report. Most of the logging messages and plot savings are commented out, feel free to uncomment if one wishes to do so.
